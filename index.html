                <p class="text-muted text-left">The North Hills logo was inspired by a crest and shield. It was meant to represent the importance of the school and that it was safe for kids at all ages. North Hills is my favorite school. The teachers are always nice and the students as well, it's a public school. It has two floors.</p>
